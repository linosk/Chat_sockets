Issue:

When client A tries to disconnect the actual disconnect does
not happens until client B sends message.
When client A is the only one disconnecting does not work.

Reproduction:

Case 1.

Server start
Adam connects
Eve connects

Adam sends /disconnect what happens in adam client and sever?

Still something wrong with disconnect from the client side
and server side
