Issue:

When client A tries to disconnect the actual disconnect does
not happens until client B sends message.
When client A is the only one disconnecting does not work.

Reproduction:

Case 1.

Server start
Adam connects
Eve connects

Adam sends /disconnect what happens in adam client and sever?

Still something wrong with disconnect from the client side
and server side

RESOLVED

Issue:

Time of the message should be added at the server side - RESOLVED
Function "terminated connection by the server side" does not work - RESOLVED NOT REALLY
Client should not get information about its own connection/disconnection
